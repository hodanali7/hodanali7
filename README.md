✨ **Hodan Ali**✨

Thanks for stopping by! 🌱👩‍💻 I’m a student at Smith College, passionate about Biology and Data Science. I’m fascinated by their intersection and the potential it holds to drive innovation and deepen our understanding of the world around us.

From unraveling complex biological mechanisms to leveraging data for informed decision-making, I enjoy combining technical depth with real-world impact. I’ve explored questions related to mortality risk, system performance, and data fairness.

I’m always seeking opportunities to expand my skills and grow as a data scientist especially through internships that align with analytics, and responsible tech.
